# iOS Unstripped Kernel Extensions, Kernels and SecureROM
These files are a great help when researching Apple firmware.  
Some of these files I dumped myself, others come from various sources on the internet (Proteas for example).  
All of the code in the binaries is licensed and proprietary property of Apple and should never be reused without their consent.  

## ROM
- Apple A11 RELEASE SecureROM dump 
- Apple A10 RELEASE SecureROM dump
- Apple A8X RELEASE SecureROM dump  
- Apple A4/A3 RELEASE SecureROM dump  

## Kernel
### Release
- Contains manually diffed production / release kernels with symbolicated kexts etc.  
- Is based off many hours of manual analysis.  

### Other directories
- Not same as production kernel, but useful for diffing.  

## Kext
- Not same as production kexts, but useful for diffing.
